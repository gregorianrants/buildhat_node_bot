# Raspberry Pi robot 

Obstacle avoiding raspberry pi robot, with distributed software architecture, at the moment this readme just gives an overview of what the hardware and does.  Soon more information will be added on both how the software works and how it was designed. 

There are parts of this project that arenâ€™t completed this will probably always be the case.  This is a passion project, it is something I plan to continuously experiment with refactor and add to.  Although there is much in an uncompleted state there is also much that can run and works brilliantly. 

This library works in conjunction with 3 other libraries.
